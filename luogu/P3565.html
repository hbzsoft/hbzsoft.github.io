<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<p>给定一棵树，在树上选 $3$ 个点，要求两两距离相等，求方案数。</p>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>There are $n$ towns in Byteotia, connected with only $n-1$ roads.</p>
<p>Each road directly links two towns.</p>
<p>All the roads have the same length and are two way.</p>
<p>It is known that every town can be reached from every other town    via a route consisting of one or more (direct-link) roads.</p>
<p>In other words, the road network forms a tree.</p>
<p>Byteasar, the king of Byteotia, wants three luxury hotels    erected to attract tourists from all over the world.</p>
<p>The king desires that the hotels be in different towns    and at the same distance one from each other.</p>
<p>Help the king out by writing a program that determines the number    of possible locations of the hotel triplet in Byteotia.</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard input contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 5\ 000$),   the number of towns in Byteotia.</p>
<p>The towns are numbered from $1$ to $n$.</p>
<p>The Byteotian road network is then described in $n-1$ lines.</p>
<p>Each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1\le a\le b\le n$) ,   separated by a single space, that indicate there is   a direct road between the towns $a$ and $b$.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>The first and only line of the standard output should contain a single integer    equal to the number of possible placements of the hotels.</p>
