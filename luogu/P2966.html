<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Like everyone else, FJ is always thinking up ways to increase his revenue. To this end, he has set up a series of tolls that the cows will pay when they traverse the cowpaths throughout the farm.</p>
<p>The cows move from any of the $N (1 \leq N \leq 250)$ pastures conveniently numbered $1...N$ to any other pasture over a set of $M (1 \leq M \leq 10,000) $bidirectional cowpaths that connect pairs of different pastures $A_j$ and $B_j (1 \leq A_j \leq N; 1 \leq B_j \leq N)$. FJ has assigned a toll $L_j (1 \leq L_j \leq 100,000)$ to the path connecting pastures $A_j$ and $B_j$.</p>
<p>While there may be multiple cowpaths connecting the same pair of pastures, a cowpath will never connect a pasture to itself. Best of all, a cow can always move from any one pasture to any other pasture by following some sequence of cowpaths.</p>
<p>In an act that can only be described as greedy, FJ has also assigned a toll $C_i (1 \leq C_i \leq 100,000)$ to every pasture. The cost of moving from one pasture to some different pasture is the sum of the tolls for each of the cowpaths that were traversed plus a <strong>single additional toll</strong> that is the maximum of all the pasture tolls encountered along the way, including the initial and destination pastures.</p>
<p>The patient cows wish to investigate their options. They want you to write a program that accepts $K (1 \leq K \leq 10,000)$ queries and outputs the minimum cost of trip specified by each query. Query $i$ is a pair of numbers $s_i$ and $t_i (1 \leq s_i \leq N; 1 \leq t_i \leq N; s_i \neq t_i)$ specifying a starting and ending pasture.</p>
<p>Consider this example diagram with five pastures:</p>
<p>The 'edge toll' for the path from pasture $1$ to pasture $2$ is $3$. Pasture $2$'s 'node toll' is $5$.</p>
<p>To travel from pasture $1$ to pasture $4$, traverse pastures $1$ to $3$ to $5$ to $4$. This incurs an edge toll of $2+1+1=4$ and a node toll of $4$ (since pasture $5$'s toll is greatest), for a total cost of $4+4=8$.</p>
<p>The best way to travel from pasture $2$ to pasture $3$ is to traverse pastures $2$ to $5$ to $3$. This incurs an edge toll of $3+1=4$ and a node toll of $5$, for a total cost of $4+5=9$.</p>
<p>给定一个 $n$ 点 $m$ 边的双向图，第 $i$ 条道路连接了 $u_i$ 与 $v_i$，边权为 $w_i$，第 $i$ 个点的点权为 $c_i$。</p>
<p>给定 $q$ 组询问，第 $i$ 组询问求从 $s_i$ 到 $t_i$ 的路径的边权之和与点权的最大值的和的最小值。</p>
<p><strong>可能有重边，但保证无自环。</strong></p>
