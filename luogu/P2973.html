<h1>[USACO10HOL] Driving Out the Piggies G</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The Cows have constructed a randomized stink bomb for the purpose of driving away the Piggies. The Piggy civilization consists of N (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 300) Piggy cities conveniently numbered 1..N connected by M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 44,850) bidirectional roads specified by their distinct endpoints A_j and B_j (1 &lt;= A_j &lt;= N; 1 &lt;= B_j &lt;= N). Piggy city 1 is always connected to at least one other city.</p>
<p>The stink bomb is deployed in Piggy city 1. Each hour (including the first one), it has a P/Q (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1,000,000; 1 &lt;= Q &lt;=</p>
<p>1,000,000; P &lt;= Q) chance of polluting the city it occupies. If it does not go off, it chooses a random road out of the city and follows it until it reaches a new city.  All roads out of a city are equally likely to be chosen.</p>
<p>Because of the random nature of the stink bomb, the Cows are wondering which cities are most likely to be polluted. Given a map of the Piggy civilization and the probability that the stink bomb detonates in a given hour, compute for each city the probability that it will be polluted.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the Piggie civilization consists of two cities connected together and that the stink bomb, which starts in city 1, has a probability of 1/2 of detonating each time it enters a city:</p>
<p>1--2
We have the following possible paths for the stink bomb (where the last entry is the ending city):</p>
<p>1: 1
2: 1-2
3: 1-2-1</p>
<p>4: 1-2-1-2</p>
<p>5: 1-2-1-2-1</p>
<p>etc.
To find the probability that the stink bomb ends at city 1, we can add up the probabilities of taking the 1st, 3rd, 5th, ... paths above (specifically, every odd-numbered path in the above list). The probability of taking path number k is exactly (1/2)^k - the bomb must not remain in its city for k - 1 turns (each time with a probability of 1 - 1/2 = 1/2) and then land in the last city</p>
<p>(probability 1/2). </p>
<p>So our probability of ending in city 1 is represented by the sum 1/2 + (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^5 + ... . When we sum these terms infinitely, we will end up with exactly 2/3 as our probability, approximately 0.666666667. This means the probability of landing in city 2 is 1/3, approximately 0.333333333. </p>

<p>一个无向图，节点1有一个炸弹，在每个单位时间内，有p/q的概率在这个节点炸掉，有1-p/q的概率随机选择一条出去的路到其他的节点上。问最终炸弹在每个节点上爆炸的概率。</p>
