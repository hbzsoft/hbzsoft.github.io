<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>To earn some extra money, the cows have opened a restaurant in their barn specializing in milkshakes.  The restaurant has N seats (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 500,000) in a row. Initially, they are all empty.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, there are M different events that happen in sequence at the restaurant (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 300,000).  The two types of events that can happen are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A party of size p arrives (1 &lt;= p &lt;= N). Bessie wants to seat the party in a contiguous block of p empty seats. If this is possible, she does so in the lowest position possible in the list of seats.  If it is impossible, the party is turned away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A range [a,b] is given (1 &lt;= a &lt;= b &lt;= N), and everybody in that range of seats leaves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please help Bessie count the total number of parties that are turned away over the course of the day.</p>
<p>有一排n个座位，m次操作。A操作：将a名客人安置到最左的连续a个空位中，没有则不操作。L操作：[a,b]的客人离开。</p>
<p>求A操作的失败次数。</p>
