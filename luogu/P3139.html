<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John has received an order for exactly $M$ units of milk ($1 \leq M \leq 200$) that he needs to fill right away.  Unfortunately, his fancy milking machine has just become broken, and all he has are two milk pails of integer sizes $X$ and $Y$ ($1 \leq X, Y \leq 100$) with which he can measure milk.  Both pails are initially empty.  Using these two pails, he can perform up to $K$ of the following types of operations ($1 \leq K \leq 100$):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He can fill either pail completely to the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He can empty either pail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He can pour the contents of one pail into the other, stopping when the former becomes empty or the latter becomes full (whichever of these happens first).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although FJ realizes he may not be able to end up with exactly $M$ total units of milk in the two pails, please help him compute the minimum amount of error between $M$ and the total amount of milk in the two pails.  That is, please compute the minimum value of $|M-M'|$ such that FJ can construct $M'$ units of milk collectively between the two  pails.
FJ最近刚收到了解决M（1&lt;=m&lt;=200)个单位牛奶的指令。他有三个桶，大小分别为X，Y(1&lt;=X，Y&lt;=100)。</p>
<p>他可以选择执行如下操作k（1&lt;=k&lt;=100）次：</p>
<p>他可以在任意一个桶中装满牛奶。</p>
<p>他可以倒空任意一个桶</p>
<p>他可以将一个桶里的奶倒入另一个桶中，直到倒空或另一个桶被倒满</p>
<p>尽管FJ意识到他可能不能在两个桶中刚好装下M个单位的牛奶，但请你算出他经过操作后，两桶牛奶的和同M的差值最小是多少。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first, and only line of input, contains $X$, $Y$, $K$, and $M$.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Output the smallest distance from $M$ to an amount of milk FJ can produce.</p>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h4>输入样例 #1</h4>
<p>14 50 2 32</p>
<h4>输出样例 #1</h4>
<p>18</p>
<h2>说明</h2>
<p>In two steps FJ can be left with the following quanities in his pails</p>
<p><code>cpp
(0, 0) = 0 units
(14, 0) = 14 units
(0, 50) = 50 units
(0, 14) = 14 units
(14, 36) = 50 units
(14, 50) = 64 units</code></p>
<p>The closest we can come to 32 units is 14 for a difference of 18.  Note that it</p>
<p>would require an extra step to pour out the first pail to end up with (0, 36).</p>
