<h1>[USACO15OPEN] Bessie Goes Moo S</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John and Bessie the cow love to exchange math puzzles in their free time.</p>
<p>The last puzzle FJ gave Bessie was quite difficult and she failed to solve it.</p>
<p>Now she wants to get even with FJ by giving him a challenging puzzle.</p>
<p>Bessie gives FJ the expression $(B+E+S+S+I+E)(G+O+E+S)(M+O+O)$, containing the</p>
<p>seven variables $B,E,S,I,G,O,M$ (the "$O$" is a variable, not a zero).  For each</p>
<p>variable, she gives FJ a list of up to 500 integer values the variable can</p>
<p>possibly take.  She asks FJ to count the number of different ways he can assign</p>
<p>values to the variables so the entire expression evaluates to a multiple of 7.</p>
<p>Note that the answer to this problem can be too large to fit into a 32-bit</p>
<p>integer, so you probably want to use 64-bit integers (e.g., "long long"s in C or</p>
<p>C++).
七个变量B,E,S,I,G,O,M;使得(B+E+S+S+I+E)(G+O+E+S)(M+O+O)被7整除的方案有多少种.</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer $N$.  The next $N$ lines each</p>
<p>contain a variable and a possible value for that variable.  Each variable will</p>
<p>appear in this list at least once and at most 500 times. No possible value will</p>
<p>be listed more than once for the same variable. All possible values will be in</p>
<p>the range $-10^5$ to $10^5$.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Print a single integer, giving the number of ways FJ can assign values to</p>
<p>variables so the expression above evaluates to a multiple of 7.</p>
