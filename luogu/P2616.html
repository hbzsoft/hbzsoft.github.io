<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John needs to travel to town to pick up K (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100) pounds of feed. Driving D miles with K pounds of feed in his truck costs D*K cents.</p>
<p>The county feed lot has N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100) stores (conveniently numbered 1..N) that sell feed. Each store is located on a segment of the X axis whose length is E (1 &lt;= E &lt;= 350). Store i is at location X_i (0 &lt; X_i &lt; E) on the number line and can sell FJ as much as F_i (1 &lt;= F_i &lt;= 100) pounds of feed at a cost of C_i (1 &lt;= C_i &lt;= 1,000,000) cents per pound. Amazingly, a given point on the X axis might have more than one store.</p>
<p>FJ starts at location 0 on this number line and can drive only in the positive direction, ultimately arriving at location E, with at least K pounds of feed. He can stop at any of the feed stores along the way and buy any amount of feed up to the the store's limit.</p>
<p>What is the minimum amount FJ has to pay to buy and transport the K pounds of feed? FJ knows there is a solution.</p>
<p>Consider a sample where FJ needs two pounds of feed from three stores (locations: 1, 3, and 4) on a number line whose range is 0..5:</p>
<p><code>0   1   2   3   4   5 
+---|---+---|---|---+ 
    1       1   1      Available pounds of feed 
    1       2   2      Cents per pound</code>
It is best for FJ to buy one pound of feed from both the second and third stores. He must pay two cents to buy each pound of feed for a total cost of 4. When FJ travels from 3 to 4 he is moving 1 unit of length and he has 1 pound of feed so he must pay 1*1 = 1 cents.</p>
<p>When FJ travels from 4 to 5 he is moving one unit and he has 2 pounds of feed so he must pay 1*2 = 2 cents.</p>
<p>The total cost is 4+1+2 = 7 cents. </p>
<p>FJ 开车去买 $K$ 份食物，如果他的车上有 $X$ 份食物。每走一里就花费 $X$ 元。FJ 的城市是一条线，总共 $E$ 里路，有 $E+1$ 个地方，标号 $0\sim E$。 FJ 从 $0$ 开始走，到 $E$ 结束（不能往回走），要买 $K$ 份食物。 城里有 $N$ 个商店，每个商店的位置是 $X_i$（一个点上可能有多个商店），有 $F_i$ 份食物，每份 $C_i$ 元。 问到达 $E$ 并买 $K$ 份食物的最小花费。</p>
