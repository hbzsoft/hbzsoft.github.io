<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>A triangular grid consists in equilateral triangles with side length 1  (see p. 3). A path in the triangular grid is an arbitrary finite  sequence of triangles (with side length 1) of the grid such that every two  successive ones share a side.</p>
<p>A shape formed by the points of any finite number of triangles is called an  isle if any two triangles of the grid contained in this shape are  connected by some path formed by the triangles contained in the shape.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://szkopul.edu.pl/problemset/problem/x71UmM6wnV9BdT-ld0uFb33p/site/images/OI16/wyspy.gif" /></p>
<p>The shapes in the figures 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 are isles.</p>
<p>The shape in the figure 1.4 is not an isle.</p>
<p>The shapes in the figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5 are congruent.</p>
<p>We aim at obtaining a systematic description, for each <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.1.png" />, of all  non-congruent isles that can be formed by <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.2.png" /> triangles with side length 1,  and calculating how many such isles there are.</p>
<p>The boundary of every isle formed by at most ten triangles is a polygonal  chain consisting of unitary segments of the grid. It can be revolved  about, i.e.</p>
<p>it can be contoured without detaching pencil from the sheet, in such a way  that its every segment is followed once, and we come back to the initial  point. It may happen though that some point has to be crossed more than  once (see Figure 2.4).</p>
<p>Luckily, in case of isles formed by at most ten triangles the shape's  perimeter is connected (and can be thus contoured without detaching pencil  from the sheet), unlike the one in Figure 1.2.</p>
<p>While circling around the perimeter, after each unit segment we make a turn  of either of the following types:</p>
<p>a - 120 degrees left,         b - 60 degrees left,         c - 0 degrees (i.e. no turn, actually),         d - 60 degrees right,         e - 120 degrees right.</p>
<p>Each cycle around the isle can be described by a word consisting of letters  from the set <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.3.png" />,  where each letter tells which turn should be made after each successive unit  segment the perimeter consists of. The cycle description has as many letters  as there are such unit segments. This means we also describe the turn after  the last segment of the polygonal chain, even though it is not required to  uniquely determine the shape. This redundant letter is, however, very helpful  in transforming one description of a cycle around the shape to another one  that differs only in the initial point.</p>
<p>The words cdddcddd, dcdddcdd, cbbbcbbb describe  different cycles around the shape of the Figure 2.1.</p>
<p>The words cbeddcde, adcabcbb, abcbbadc describe  different cycles around the shape of the Figure 2.2.</p>
<p>The words acdabbcb i cddebced describe  different cycles around the shape of the Figure 2.3.</p>
<p>If the inside of the shape is constantly on right hand side during a cycle  around some shape, we call such cycle a clockwise cycle.</p>
<p>One can determine, for each isle, the set of all isles congruent with it and  these isles' clockwise cycles.</p>
<p>The code of an isle is such a word that:</p>
<p>it is a description of a clockwise cycle around the contour of some isle congruent with the latter,         it is the lexicographically smallest of all words satisfying the previous condition.</p>
<p>For the isle depicted in Figures 2.2 and 2.3, which are congruent, we take  into account all clockwise cycles around each of them:</p>
<p>beddcdec, eddcdecb, ddcdecbe, dcdecbed, cdecbedd,  decbeddc, ecbeddcd, cbeddcde  and  bcedcdde, cedcddeb, edcddebc, dcddebce, cddebced,  ddebcedc, debcedcd, ebcedcdd  so their common code is: bcedcdde, the lexicographically smallest of  all the words above.</p>
<p>The code of the isle depicted in Figure 2.4 is: aadecddcddde.</p>
<p>Write a programme that:</p>
<p>for a given code of an isle of size <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.4.png" /> generates the codes of all isles of size <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.5.png" /> that can be obtained from the latter by adding one triangle to it,         for a given integer <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.6.png" /> generates the codes of all isles of size <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/wys-en-tex.7.png" />.</p>
