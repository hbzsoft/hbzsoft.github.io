<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<p>给定一个非负整数序列 $A$，每次操作可以选择一个数然后减掉 $1$，要求进行不超过 $m$ 次操作使得存在一个 $A_k=0$ 且 $\max(|x_i-x_{i-1}|)$ 最小，输出使其最小的 $k$ 与这个最小值。</p>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Byteasar has set off on a journey along the Dry River, which crosses the Byteotian Desert.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Dry River has dried out, and Byteasar has run out of water.</p>
<p>His only hope is to dig a deep enough well in the dried river bed.</p>
<p>Realising the graveness of his situation, Byteasar decides to plan everything carefully before he actually starts digging.</p>
<p>The danger is that he drains his strength before he reaches the water level - in such case he is unlikely to survive.</p>
<p>He managed to determine the depth of the water level.  He also knows how much he can dig before losing strength.</p>
<p>His only worry is a possible landslide, which might bury him alive.</p>
<p>He sends you (via a satellite telephone) a topographic map of the river bed.</p>
<p>And, of course, he asks you to help him determine where he should dig so that he reaches water before draining his strength    while keeping the slope of his excavation as gentle as possible.</p>
<p>He is waiting for your advice!</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard input two positive integers are given, $n$ and $m$ ($1\le n\le 1\ 000\ 000$, $1\le m\le 10^{18}$), separated by a single space.</p>
<p>The second line holds $n$ positive integers $x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$ ($1\le x_i\le 10^9$), also separated by single spaces.</p>
<p>Byteasar has enough energy to perform $m$ swings of the shovel.</p>
<p>The numbers $x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n$ describe the topography of the Dry River's bed.</p>
<p>They represent the depth of the sand layer above the ground water level in successive one meter spaced spots along the river bed.</p>
<p>With a single swing of the shovel Byteasar can extract an amount of the sand that decreases any of the numbers $x_i$ by 1.If any of these numbers, say $x_k$, drops to 0, this means that Byteasar has dug down to the water. But Byteasar has a secondary goal as well. He wants the following number $z$, characterising the slope of the sand hill, minimised:</p>
<p>$z=max_{i=1,2,\cdots,n-1}|x_i-x_{i+1}|$
If there are multiple correct values of the number $k$,representing the spot where Byteasar is to dig down to reach the water, your program can pick one arbitrarily. The spots $1,2,\cdots,n$ are the only ones suitable for digging - elsewhere there is rock rather than sand. You may assume that Byteasar has enough energy to reach water at one of the spots.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Your program should print two integers to the standard output, separated by a single space:</p>
<p>the spot $k$, where Byteasar should dig for water, and the minimum value of the number $z$.</p>
