<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The annual rich citizen's reunion is taking place in Byteotia.</p>
<p>They meet to boast about their incomes, Lebytene's shoes and other luxuries.</p>
<p>Naturally, not all these objects of pride are carried into the banquet - coats,  jackets, umbrellas and such are left in the cloakroom, and picked up upon leave.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the well off, a gang of Byteotian thieves plans to break into  the cloakroom and steal part of the items stored therein.</p>
<p>At this very moment the gang's leader is examining the plans of the robbery put  forward by other gang members (they are a democratic lot!).</p>
<p>A plan typically looks as follows: the thieves break into the cloakroom at time $m_j$,  take items worth exactly $k_j$ and escape, where the whole heist takes them $s_j$ time.</p>
<p>The gang leader would first of all like to know which of these plans are feasible and which are not.</p>
<p>A plan is feasible if at time $m_j$ it is possible to collect items of total value $k_j$ in such a way  that up to the very $m_j+s_j$ moment no one shows up to retrieve any of the stolen goods  (in such event, they would notify security, and the robbery would fail).</p>
<p>In particular, if at time $m_j$ it is impossible to select items of exact total worth $k_j$,  then the plan is infeasible and consequently rejected.</p>
<p>Knowing the drop off and retrieval times for each item, determine which plans are feasible and which are not.</p>
<p>We assume that an item left in the cloakroom the moment a robbery starts can already be stolen (see the example).</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer $n$($1\le n\le 1\ 000$) denoting the number of items that will be left in the cloakroom.</p>
<p>Those items are described in the $n$ lines that follow.</p>
<p>Each of those lines consists of three integers $c_i$, $a_i$, and $b_i$ ($1\le c_i\le 1\ 000$, $1\le a_i&lt;b_i\le 10^9$),  separated by single spaces, that denote respectively: the item's value, the moment it is left in the cloakroom,  and the moment it will be retrieved by the owner.</p>
<p>The next line holds an integer $p$ ($1\le p\le 1\ 000\ 000$),the number of plans the gang came up with. Each is specified in a separate line by three integers,$m_j$,$k_j$ and $s_j$($1\le m_j\le 10^9$,$1\le k_j\le 100\ 000$,$0\le s_j\le 10^9$), separated by single spaces, that denote respectively: the moment the thieves would enter the cloakroom, the value of goods they would like to steal, and the time the robbery would take them.</p>
<p>In test worth 16% of the total points $p\le 10$ holds in addition.</p>
<p>n some other tests, also worth 16% of the points, all the items have the same $a_i$ values.</p>
<p>In yet other tests, worth 24% of the points, all the queries share the same $s_j$ value.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>For each plan put forward by the gang determine if it is feasible, i.e., whether it is possible  to steal items of total worth exactly $k_j$ and escape before anyone asks for their belongings.</p>
<p>If the plan is feasible, your program should print the word TAK (Polish for yes) on the  standard output, otherwise it should print NIE (Polish for no).</p>
