<h1>[POI2012] SQU-Squarks</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>A famous Byteotian physicist Byteasar is studying a new constituent of matter - squarks.</p>
<p>These are quite exotic particles that never exist alone but always in pairs.</p>
<p>Moreover, squarks of a particular kind form pairs only with squarks of different kinds.</p>
<p>After years of studies Byteasar has established that there are <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.1.png" /> different kinds of squarks.</p>
<p>Squarks of each kind have a unique mass, which is a positive integer multiple of (an appropriate) unit.</p>
<p>Byteasar has also measured the total mass of each of the <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.2.png" /> possible pairs of squarks.</p>
<p>According to standard Byteotian model of physics, the mass of a pair of squarks equals the sum of the masses    of the two squarks forming it.</p>
<p>Now Byteasar desires to determine the individual masses of squarks of every kind.</p>
<p>He has asked your help in writing a program that will determine all solutions to this puzzle,    i.e., will reconstruct all configurations of squark masses that are consistent with his previous measurements.</p>
<p>设有n个互不相同的正整数{X1,X2,…Xn}，任取两个Xi,Xj(i≠j)，能算出Xi+Xj。现在所有取法共n*(n-1)/2个和，要你求出X1,X2,…Xn。</p>
<p>3&lt;=n&lt;=300, 每个正整数不超过10^8</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.3.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.4.png" />)      that denotes the number of different kinds of squarks.</p>
<p>In the second line there are <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.5.png" /> positive integers, separated by single spaces,      that denote the total masses of all possible pairs of squarks.</p>
<p>The mass of every pair does not exceed <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.6.png" />.</p>
<p>For each two different kinds of squarks, the mass of the pair they form is given on the input exactly once.</p>
<pre><code>  The masses on the input are given in a random order.
</code></pre>
<p>In tests worth 32% of the points the following conditions hold in addition:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.7.png" /> and the mass of every pair of squarks does not exceed <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.8.png" />.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard output your program should print the number <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.9.png" /> of possible solutions to the problem.</p>
<p>In the <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.10.png" /> lines that follow it should report successive solutions, one per line.</p>
<p>Each solution should consist of <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.11.png" /> different positive integers, namely the masses of squarks of all kinds.</p>
<p>In every solution these should be given in increasing order and separated by single spaces.</p>
<p>Solutions can be reported in arbitrary order, but they cannot be repeated.</p>
<p>You may assume that for each test data there exists at least one solution, i.e., <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI19/squ-en-tex.12.png" />.</p>
