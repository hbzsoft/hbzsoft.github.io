<h1>[POI2010] GRA-The Minima Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Alice and Bob learned the minima game, which they like very much, recently.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are as follows.</p>
<p>A certain number of cards lies on a table, each inscribed with a positive integer.</p>
<p>The players make alternate moves, Alice making the first one.</p>
<p>A move consists in picking an arbitrary positive number of cards from the table.</p>
<p>For such move the player receives a number of points equal to the minimum    of the numbers inscribed on the cards he collected.</p>
<p>The game ends when the last card is removed from the table.</p>
<p>The goal of each player is maximizing the difference between their and their opponent's score.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob have duly noted that there is an optimal strategy in the game.</p>
<p>Thus they are asking you to write a program that, for a given set of cards,    determines the outcome of the game when both players play optimally.</p>
<p>给出N个正整数，AB两个人轮流取数，A先取。每次可以取任意多个数，直到N个数都被取走。每次获得的得分为取的数中的最小值，A和B的策略都是尽可能使得自己的得分减去对手的得分更大。在这样的情况下，最终A的得分减去B的得分为多少。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard input there is one integer <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gra-en-tex.1.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gra-en-tex.2.png" />) given,      denoting the number of cards.</p>
<p>The second line holds <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gra-en-tex.3.png" /> positive integers <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gra-en-tex.4.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/gra-en-tex.5.png" />),      separated by single spaces, that are inscribed on the cards.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Your program should print out a single line with a single integer to the standard      output - the number of points by which Alice wins over Bob, assuming they both play optimally;      if it is Bob who has more points, the result should be negative.</p>
