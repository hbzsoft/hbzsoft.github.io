<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John's cows are getting restless about their poor telephone service; they want FJ to replace the old telephone wire with new, more efficient wire. The new wiring will utilize N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) already-installed telephone poles, each with some heighti meters (1 ≤ heighti ≤ 100). The new wire will connect the tops of each pair of adjacent poles and will incur a penalty cost C × the two poles' height difference for each section of wire where the poles are of different heights (1 ≤ C ≤ 100). The poles, of course, are in a certain sequence and can not be moved.</p>
<p>Farmer John figures that if he makes some poles taller he can reduce his penalties, though with some other additional cost. He can add an integer X number of meters to a pole at a cost of X2.</p>
<p>Help Farmer John determine the cheapest combination of growing pole heights and connecting wire so that the cows can get their new and improved service.</p>
<p>给出若干棵树的高度，你可以进行一种操作：把某棵树增高h，花费为h*h。</p>
<p>操作完成后连线，两棵树间花费为高度差*定值c。</p>
<p>求两种花费加和最小值。</p>
