<h1>[POI2013] LUK-Triumphal arch</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The king of Byteotia, Byteasar, is returning to his country after a victorious battle.</p>
<p>In Byteotia, there are <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.1.png" /> towns connected with only <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.2.png" /> roads.</p>
<p>It is known that every town can be reached from every other town by a unique route,    consisting of one or more (direct) roads.</p>
<pre><code>(In other words, the road network forms a tree).
</code></pre>
<p>The king has just entered the capital.</p>
<p>Therein a triumphal arch, i.e., a gate a victorious king rides through, has been erected.</p>
<p>Byteasar, delighted by a warm welcome by his subjects, has planned a    triumphal procession to visit all the towns of Byteotia, starting with the capital he is currently in.</p>
<p>The other towns are not ready to greet their king just yet -    the constructions of the triumphal arches in those towns did not even begin!</p>
<p>But Byteasar's trusted advisor is seeing to the issue.</p>
<pre><code>He desires to hire a number of construction crews.

Every crew can construct a single arch each day, in any town.

Unfortunately, no one knows the order in which the king will visit the towns.
</code></pre>
<p>The only thing that is clear is that every day the king will travel from the city he is currently in to a neighboring one.</p>
<p>The king may visit any town an arbitrary number of times    (but as he is not vain, one arch in each town will suffice).</p>
<p>Byteasar's advisor has to pay each crew the same flat fee, regardless of how many arches this crew builds.</p>
<p>Thus, while he needs to ensure that every town has an arch when it is visited by the king, he wants to hire as few crews as possible.</p>
<p>Help him out by writing a program that will determine the minimum number    of crews that allow a timely delivery of the arches.</p>
<p>给一颗 $n$ 个节点的树（$n \le 3 \times 10^5$），初始时 $1$ 号节点被染黑，其余是白的。两个人轮流操作，一开始 B 在 $1$ 号节点。每一轮，A 选择 $k$ 个点染黑，然后 B 走到一个相邻节点，如果 B 当前处于白点则 B 胜，否则当 A 将所有点染为黑点时 A 胜。求能让 A 获胜的最小的 $k$ 。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard input contains a single integer <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.3.png" />    (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.4.png" />), the number of towns in Byteotia.</p>
<p>The towns are numbered from 1 to <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.5.png" />, where the number 1 corresponds to the capital.</p>
<p>The road network is described in <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.6.png" /> lines that then follow.</p>
<p>Each of those lines contains two integers, <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.7.png" />    (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.8.png" />), separated by a single space,    indicating that towns <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.9.png" /> and <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.10.png" /> are directly connected with a two way road.</p>
<p>In tests worth 50% of the total points, an additional condition <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/luk-en-tex.11.png" /> holds.</p>
