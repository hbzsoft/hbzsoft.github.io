<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<p>给定一个 $n$ 个点，$m$ 条边的无向图，其中你在第 $i$ 个点建立旅游站点的费用为 $C_i$。在这张图中，任意两点间不存在节点数超过 $10$ 的简单路径。请找到一种费用最小的建立旅游站点的方案，使得每个点要么建立了旅游站点，要么与它有边直接相连的点里至少有一个点建立了旅游站点。</p>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>King Byteasar believes that Byteotia, a land full of beautiful sights, should attract lots of tourists,    who should spend lots of money, which should eventually find their way to the royal treasury.</p>
<p>But reality does not live up to his dream.</p>
<p>So the king instructed his councilor to look into this issue.</p>
<p>The councilor found out that foreigners keep away from Byteotia due to its sparse road network.</p>
<p>Let us remark that there are $n$ towns in Byteotia, connected by $m$ two way roads, each road linking two different towns.</p>
<p>The roads may lead through picturesque overflies and somewhat less picturesque tunnels.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that every town can be reached from every other town.</p>
<p>The councilor observed that the current road network does not allow for a long journey.</p>
<p>Namely, wherever one starts the journey, it is impossible to visit more than 10 towns without passing through some town twice.</p>
<p>Due to limited funds in the treasury, no new roads will be constructed at the time.</p>
<p>Instead, Byteasar has decided to build a network of tourist information points (TIPs),    staffed by officers who are to advertise the short trips that are available.</p>
<p>For each town, there should be a TIP either in this town or one of the towns directly    linked by a road.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cost of building the TIP is known for each town.</p>
<p>Help the king by finding the cheapest way of building TIPs that will satisfy aforementioned condition.</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard input contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2\le n\le 20\ 000$ ,$0\le m\le 25\ 000$), separated by a single space,    that specify the number of towns and roads in Byteotia respectively.</p>
<p>The towns are numbered from $1$ to $n$.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains $n$ integers $c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_n$ ($0\le c_i\le 10\ 000$),    separated by single spaces; the number $c_i$ specifies the cost of building a TIP in the town no. $i$.</p>
<p>Then, a description of the Byteotian road network follows. The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $a_i$,$b_i$ ($1\le a_i&lt;b_i\le n$), separated by a single space, that indicate that the towns no. $a_i$ and $b_i$ are linked by a road. There is at most one (direct) road between any pair of towns.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Your program should print out one integer to the standard output: the total cost of building all the TIPs.</p>
