<h1>[USACO11NOV] Above the Median G</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John has lined up his N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000) cows in a row to measure their heights; cow i has height H_i (1 &lt;= H_i &lt;= 1,000,000,000) nanometers--FJ believes in precise measurements! He wants to take a picture of some contiguous subsequence of the cows to submit to a bovine photography contest at the county fair.</p>
<p>The fair has a very strange rule about all submitted photos: a photograph is only valid to submit if it depicts a group of cows whose median height is at least a certain threshold X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 1,000,000,000).</p>
<p>For purposes of this problem, we define the median of an array A[0...K] to be A[ceiling(K/2)] after A is sorted, where ceiling(K/2) gives K/2 rounded up to the nearest integer (or K/2 itself, it K/2 is an integer to begin with). For example the median of {7, 3, 2, 6} is 6, and the median of {5, 4, 8} is 5.</p>
<p>Please help FJ count the number of different contiguous subsequences of his cows that he could potentially submit to the photography contest.</p>
<p>给出一串数字，问中位数大于等于X的连续子串有几个。（这里如果有偶数个数，定义为偏大的那一个而非中间取平均）</p>

<p>* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the single integer H_i.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>* Line 1: The number of subsequences of FJ's cows that have median at least X. Note this may not fit into a 32-bit integer.</p>

<h2>说明</h2>
<p>FJ's four cows have heights 10, 5, 6, 2. We want to know how many contiguous subsequences have median at least 6.</p>
<p>There are 10 possible contiguous subsequences to consider. Of these, only 7 have median at least 6. They are {10}, {6}, {10, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 2}, {10, 5, 6}, {10, 5, 6, 2}.</p>
