<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The habitants of the Byteotian Highland bred sheep for centuries.</p>
<p>Every sane shepherd has a fenced pasture in the shape of a convex1 polygon    for the sheep to graze on.</p>
<p>Every sane sheep in turn has its own favourite feeding spot on the pasture where it spends all days.</p>
<p>Sometimes however, the sheep want to play. As they play in pairs, every shepherd keeps an even number of sheep,    so that his every sheep has a partner to play with.</p>
<p>The shepherds are concerned about a decree recently issued by the Byteburg's High Commissioner for Agriculture.</p>
<p>The decree states that as of the next year the sheep can only graze on triangle-shaped pastures.</p>
<p>Thus every shepherd whose pasture is an <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.1.png" />-gon for <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.2.png" /> is to partition it into triangles by putting <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/owc-en-tex.3.png" />    fences inside.</p>
<p>Each single new fence, of course, is going to be a segment connecting two vertices of the polygon (pasture).</p>
<p>Additionally, the fences can intersect only in these vertices.</p>
<p>A shepherd who does not fulfil these requirements will no longer be subsidized.</p>
<p>Byteasar, as a shepherd, has to decide on a way of partitioning his pasture.</p>
<p>In fact, he is unsure how many partitions are possible. He is only interested in such partitions    that no fence is drawn through a favourite spot of any sheep, and such that every resulting triangle    contains the favourite spots of an even number of sheep, so that these sheep can play in pairs.</p>
<p>Help Byteasar by writing a program that calculates the number of such partitions!</p>
