<h1>[POI2006] NAJ-The Invasion</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>And so it has come - the Triangles have invaded Byteotia!</p>
<p>Byteotia lies on an island, occupying its entire surface.</p>
<p>The shape of the island is a convex polygon(i.e. a polygon whose each inner angle is smaller than $180\degree$).</p>
<p>A certain number of software factories are located in Byteotia, each of which generates constant gains or losses.</p>
<p>The Triangles have decided to occupy such a part of Byteotia which:</p>
<p>is a triangle-shaped area, the vertices of which are three different vertices of the polygon-island,     brings the largest income i.e. the sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within the occupied area is maximal.</p>
<p>We assume that a factory located on the border or in the vertex of occupied area belongs to that area. A territory which contains no factory brings, obviously, a zero income.</p>
<p>Byteasar, the King of Byteotia, is concerned by the amount of losses the Triangles' invasion could generate. Help him by writing a programme which shall calculate the sum of gains and losses generated by factories which the Triangles wish to capture.</p>
<p>TaskWrite a programme which:</p>
<p>reads a decription of Byteotia's shape and the locations of factories from the input file,     determines the maximal value of sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within a triangle, whose vertices are three different vertices of the polygon island,     writes the outcome to the output file.</p>
<p>给定一个凸包， 并给出凸包内部或边上的若干个资源，每个资源都有权值,现在要在凸包上面选择不同的3个点，使得3个点组成的三角形</p>
<p>内部的资源的权值之和最大。</p>
<p>凸包点个数 $n \le 600$</p>
<p>资源个数 $m \le 10000$</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 600$), denoting the number of vertices of the polygon-island.</p>
<p>The following $n$ lines of the input contain two integers each $x_j$ and $y_j$ ($-10\ 000 \le x_j, y_j \le 10\ 000$), separated by a single space, denoting the coordinates $x$ and $y$ of consecutive vertices of the island, in a clockwise order.</p>
<p>The $(n+2)$-nd line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 10\ 000$), denoting thetotal number of factories.</p>
<p>In each of the following $m$ lines there are three integers $x_i'$, $y_i'$ and $w_i$ ($-10\ 000 \le x_i', y_i' \le 10\ 000$, $-100\ 000 \le w_i \le 100\ 000$), separated by single spaces, denoting: the coordinates $x$ and $y$ of the $i$-th factory and the gain (for $w_i \ge 0$) or loss (for $w_i &lt; 0$) this factory generates, respectively. Each factory is situated on the polygon-island i.e. within or on the border of it. Distinct factories may be located in the same place i.e. have the same coordinates.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>The first and only line of the output file should contain a single integer denoting the maximal value of sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within a triangle whose vertices are three different vertices of the polygon-island. Notice that it may happen that the outcome is a negative integer.</p>
