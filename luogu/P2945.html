<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Farmer John has built a sand castle! Like all good castles, the walls have crennelations, that nifty pattern of embrasures (gaps) and merlons (filled spaces); see the diagram below. The N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 25,000) merlons of his castle wall are conveniently numbered 1..N; merlon i has height M_i (1 &lt;= M_i &lt;= 100,000); his merlons often have varying heights, unlike so many.</p>
<p>He wishes to modify the castle design in the following fashion: he has a list of numbers B_1 through B_N (1 &lt;= B_i &lt;= 100,000), and wants to change the merlon heights to those heights B_1, ..., B_N in some order (not necessarily the order given or any other order derived from the data).</p>
<p>To do this, he has hired some bovine craftsmen to raise and lower the merlons' heights. Craftsmen, of course, cost a lot of money. In particular, they charge FJ a total X (1 &lt;= X &lt;= 100) money per unit height added and Y (1 &lt;= Y &lt;= 100) money per unit height</p>
<p>reduced.</p>
<p>FJ would like to know the cheapest possible cost of modifying his sand castle if he picks the best permutation of heights. The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.</p>
<p>Note: about 40% of the test data will have N &lt;= 9, and about 60% will have N &lt;= 18.</p>
<p>约翰用沙子建了一座城堡．正如所有城堡的城墙，这城墙也有许多枪眼，两个相邻枪眼中间那部分叫作“城齿”．    城墙上一共有N(1≤N≤25000)个城齿，每一个都有一个高度Mi.(1≤Mi≤100000)．现在约翰想把城齿的高度调成某种顺序下的Bi，B2，…，BN(1≤Bi≤100000). -个城齿每提高一个单位的高度，约翰需要X(1≤X≤100)元；每降低一个单位的高度，约翰需要Y(1≤y≤100)元．    问约翰最少可用多少钱达到目的．数据保证答案不超过2^31-1．</p>

<h2>说明</h2>
<p>FJ's castle starts with heights of 3, 1, and 1. He would like to change them so that their heights are 1, 2, and 2, in some order. It costs 6 to add a unit of height and 5 to remove a unit of height.</p>
<p>FJ reduces the first merlon's height by 1, for a cost of 5 (yielding merlons of heights 2, 1, and 1). He then adds one unit of height to the second merlon for a cost of 6 (yielding merlons of heights 2, 2, and 1).</p>
