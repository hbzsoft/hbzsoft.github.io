<h1>[POI2010] KOL-Railway</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>A railroad siding consists of two (dead-end) sidetracks 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The siding is entered by track A, and left by track B (see figure below).</p>
<p>There are <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.1.png" /> cars on track A, numbered from <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.2.png" /> to <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.3.png" />.</p>
<p>They are arranged in such a way that they enter the siding in the order    <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.4.png" />.</p>
<p>The cars are to be transferred to the siding, so that they leave it by track B    in the order <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.5.png" />.</p>
<p>Each car is to be transferred once from track A to one of the sidetracks 1 or 2,    and later (possibly after some transfers of the remaining cars) once from that    sidetrack to the track B.</p>
<p>The sidetracks are long enough to store even the longest trains, so there is    no need to worry about their capacity.</p>
<p>数据范围10W的双栈排序..双栈排序是啥呢？给你一个序列和两个栈，每次你可以把序列头入到两个栈的任意一个，或者把两个栈的任意一个弹出到最终序列，最后要求最终序列是有序的，求一种字典序最小的入栈方案</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard input holds one integer <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.6.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.7.png" />)      that denotes the number of cars for transfer.</p>
<p>The second line stores the numbers <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.8.png" /> that are a permutation of <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.9.png" />      (i.e., each <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.10.png" /> belongs to <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.11.png" />, and all these numbers are unique),      separated by single spaces.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard output should contain the word TAK      (yes in Polish) if there is a way of transferring the cars so that they      enter track B in the order <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.12.png" />, or the word NIE      (no in Polish) if it is impossible.</p>
<p>If the answer is TAK, the second line should give, separated by      single spaces, the numbers of sidetracks (1 or 2) to which successive cars      <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI17/kol-en-tex.13.png" /> are moved in a correct transfer.</p>
<p>If there are several ways of making the transfer, choose one arbitrarily.</p>
