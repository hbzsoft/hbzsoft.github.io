<h1>[USACO07MAR] Ranking the Cows G</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Each of Farmer John's N cows (1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000) produces milk at a different positive rate, and FJ would like to order his cows according to these rates from the fastest milk producer to the slowest.</p>
<p>FJ has already compared the milk output rate for M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000) pairs of cows. He wants to make a list of C additional pairs of cows such that, if he now compares those C pairs, he will definitely be able to deduce the correct ordering of all N cows. Please help him determine the minimum value of C for which such a list is possible.</p>
<p>FJ想按照奶牛产奶的能力给她们排序。现在已知有N头奶牛（1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000）。FJ通过比较，已经知道了M（1 ≤ M ≤ 10,000）对相对关系。每一对关系表示为“X Y”，意指X的产奶能力强于Y。现在FJ想要知道，他至少还要调查多少对关系才能完成整个排序。</p>

<h2>说明</h2>
<p>From the information in the 5 test results, Farmer John knows that since cow 2 &gt; cow 1 &gt; cow 5 and cow 2 &gt; cow 3 &gt; cow 4, cow 2 has the highest rank. However, he needs to know whether cow 1 &gt; cow 3 to determine the cow with the second highest rank. Also, he will need one more question to determine the ordering between cow 4 and cow 5. After that, he will need to know if cow 5 &gt; cow 3 if cow 1 has higher rank than cow 3. He will have to ask three questions in order to be sure he has the rankings: "Is cow 1 &gt; cow 3?  Is cow 4 &gt; cow 5? Is cow 5 &gt; cow 3?"</p>
