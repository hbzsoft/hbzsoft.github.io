<h1>[USACO17FEB] Why Did the Cow Cross the Road II S</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The long road through Farmer John's farm has $N$ crosswalks across it, conveniently numbered $1 \ldots N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100,000$). To allow cows to cross at these crosswalks, FJ installs electric crossing signals, which light up with a green cow icon when it is ok for the cow to cross, and red otherwise. Unfortunately, a large electrical storm has damaged some of his signals. Given a list of the damaged signals, please compute the minimum number of signals that FJ needs to repair in order for there to exist some contiguous block of at least $K$ working signals.</p>
<p>共有N个信号灯，编号为1~N，有B个信号灯损坏，给你它们的编号。</p>
<p>问，最少修好几个信号灯，可以有K个编号连续的信号灯。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of input contains $N$, $K$, and $B$ ($1 \leq B, K \leq N$). The next $B$ lines each describe the ID number of a broken signal</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Please compute the minimum number of signals that need to be repaired in order for there to be a contiguous block of $K$ working signals somewhere along the road.</p>
