<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Cow curling is a popular cold-weather sport played in the Moolympics.</p>
<p>Like regular curling, the sport involves two teams, each of which slides N heavy stones (3 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) across a sheet of ice.  At the end of the game, there are 2N stones on the ice, each located at a distinct 2D point.</p>
<p>Scoring in the cow version of curling is a bit curious, however.  A stone is said to be "captured" if it is contained inside a triangle whose corners are stones owned by the opponent (a stone on the boundary of such a triangle also counts as being captured).  The score for a team is the number of opponent stones that are captured.</p>
<p>Please help compute the final score of a cow curling match, given the locations of all 2N stones.</p>
<p>有两支队伍在比赛，一队可以一次取出3个点来，所围成的三角形覆盖的区域可以“捕获”对方的点，问两支队伍各能够捕获对方多少个点。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>* Line 1: The integer N.</p>
<p>* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains 2 integers specifying the x and y coordinates of a stone for team A (each coordinate lies in the range -40,000 .. +40,000).</p>
<p>* Lines 2+N..1+2N: Each line contains 2 integers specifying the x and y coordinates of a stone for team B (each coordinate lies in the range -40,000 .. +40,000).</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, giving the scores for teams A and B.</p>

<h2>说明</h2>
<p>Each team owns 4 stones.  Team A has stones at (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), and (2,2), and team B has stones at (1,1), (1,10), (-10,3), and (10,3).</p>
<p>Team A captures their opponent's stone at (1,1).  Team B captures their opponent's stones at (0,2) and (2,2).</p>
