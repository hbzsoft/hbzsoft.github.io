<p>Byteasar works for the BAJ company, which sells computer games.</p>
<p>The BAJ company cooperates with many courier companies    that deliver the games sold by the BAJ company to its customers.</p>

<p>He has a log of successive packages with the courier company that made the delivery    specified for each package.</p>
<p>He wants to make sure that no courier company had an unfair advantage over the others.</p>
<p>If a given courier company delivered more than half of all packages sent in some period of time,    we say that it dominated in that period.</p>
<p>Byteasar wants to find out which courier companies dominated in certain periods of time, if any.</p>
<p>Help Byteasar out!</p>
<p>Write a program that determines a dominating courier company or that there was none.</p>
<p>给一个数列，每次询问一个区间内有没有一个数出现次数超过一半</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>The first line of the standard input contains two integers, <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.1.png" /> and <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.2.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.3.png" />),    separated by a single space, that are the number of packages shipped by the BAJ company    and the number of time periods for which the dominating courier is to be determined, respectively.</p>
<p>The courier companies are numbered from <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.4.png" /> to (at most) <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.5.png" />.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.6.png" /> integers, <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.7.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.8.png" />),    separated by single spaces;    <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.9.png" /> is the number of the courier company that delivered the <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.10.png" />-th package (in shipment chronology).</p>
<p>The <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.11.png" /> lines that follow specify the time period queries, one per line.</p>
<p>Each query is specified by two integers, <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.12.png" /> and <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.13.png" /> (<img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.14.png" />),    separated by a single space.</p>
<p>These mean that the courier company dominating in the period between the shipments of the    <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.15.png" />-th and the <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.16.png" />-th package, including those, is to be determined.</p>
<p>In tests worth <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.17.png" /> of total score, the condition <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.18.png" /> holds,    and in tests worth <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.19.png" /> of total score <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.20.png" />.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>The answers to successive queries should be printed to the standard output, one per line.</p>
<p>(Thus a total of <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.21.png" /> lines should be printed.)    Each line should hold a single integer: the number of the courier company that dominated    in the corresponding time period, or <img alt="" src="http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.22.png" /> if there was no such company.</p>
