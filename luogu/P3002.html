<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>FJ has had a terrible fight with his neighbor and wants to send him a nasty letter, but wants to remain anonymous. As so many before him have done, he plans to cut out printed letters and paste them onto a sheet of paper. He has an infinite number of the most recent issue of the Moo York Times that has N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) uppercase letters laid out in a long string (though read in as a series of shorter strings). Likewise, he has a message he'd like to compose that is a single long string of letters but that is read in as a set of shorter strings.</p>
<p>Being lazy, he wants to make the smallest possible number of cuts. FJ has a really great set of scissors that enables him to remove any single-line snippet from the Moo York Times with one cut. He notices that he can cut entire words or phrases with a single cut, thus reducing his total number of cuts.</p>
<p>What is the minimum amount of cuts he has to make to construct his letter of M (1 &lt;= M &lt;= 50,000) letters?</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that it is possible for FJ to complete his task.</p>
<p>Consider a 38 letter Moo York Times:</p>
<p><code>cpp
THEQUICKBROWNFOXDO 
GJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG 
from which FJ wants to construct a 9 letter message: 
FOXDOG 
DOG</code>
These input lines represent a pair of strings:
THEQUICKBROWNFOXDOGJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG </p>
<p>FOXDOGDOG </p>
<p>Since 'FOXDOG' exists in the newspaper, FJ can cut this piece out and then get the last 'DOG' by cutting out either instance of the word 'DOG'. </p>
<p>Thus, he requires but two cuts.</p>
<p>FJ 刚刚和邻居发生了一场可怕的争吵，他咽不下这口气，于是决定佚名发给他的邻居一封脏话连篇的信。他有无限张完全相同的已经打印好的纸张，都包含 $N$ 个字母。他有一把举世无双的剪刀，可以从某张纸中通过一刀剪出连续的一段（也可以通过一刀获得整个字符串）。他想知道获得这封 $M$ 个字母的长信最少需要剪多少刀。保证这总是可能的。</p>
