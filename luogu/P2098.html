<h1>[USACO16DEC] Team Building P</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<p>每年，Farmer John 都要带领他的 $N$ 头奶牛参加才艺比赛，他的对手 Farmer Paul，会带着 $M$ 头奶牛参加比赛。</p>
<p>所有 $N+M$ 头奶牛都会得到评委给出的一个分数。而比赛的最终结果将取决于 $K$ 头奶牛组成的队伍。更具体地来说，FJ 和 FP 各自从自己的奶牛中挑选 $K$ 头奶牛组队，FJ 队伍中分数最高的奶牛将和 FP 队伍中分数最高的奶牛进行比较，FJ 队伍中分数次高的奶牛将和 FP 队伍中分数次高的奶牛进行比较，以此类推。如果 FJ 队伍中的每头奶牛的分数都比相对应的对手的分数高的话，FJ 就获得了胜利。</p>
<p>现在请你求出，在所有的组队情况中，有多少种情况 FJ 能取得胜利，输出方案数对 $1\,000\,000\,009$ 取模的结果。</p>
<p>数据范围：$1\leq N,M \leq 1000$,$1 \leq K \leq 10$。</p>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Every year, Farmer John brings his $N$ cows to compete for "best in show" at the state fair. His arch-rival, Farmer Paul, brings his $M$ cows to compete as well ($1 \leq N \leq 1000, 1 \leq M \leq 1000$).</p>
<p>Each of the $N + M$ cows at the event receive an individual integer score. However, the final competition this year will be determined based on teams of $K$ cows ($1 \leq K \leq 10$), as follows: Farmer John and Farmer Paul both select teams of $K$ of their respective cows to compete. The cows on these two teams are then paired off: the highest-scoring cow on FJ's team is paired with the highest-scoring cow on FP's team, the second-highest-scoring cow on FJ's team is paired with the second-highest-scoring cow on FP's team, and so on. FJ wins if in each of these pairs, his cow has the higher score.</p>
<p>Please help FJ count the number of different ways he and FP can choose their teams such that FJ will win the contest. That is, each distinct pair (set of $K$ cows for FJ, set of $K$ cows for FP) where FJ wins should be counted. Print your answer modulo 1,000,000,009.</p>
