<h1>[POI2013] MOR-Tales of seafaring</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>Young Bytensson loves to hang out in the port tavern, where he often    listens to the sea dogs telling their tales of seafaring.</p>
<p>Initially, he believed them all, however incredible they sounded.</p>
<p>Over time though, he became suspicious.</p>
<p>He has decided to write a program that will verify if there may be    any grain of truth in those tall stories.</p>
<p>Bytensson reasoned that while he cannot tell if the sailors indeed    weathered all those storms, he can at least find out if their travel    itineraries make sense.</p>
<p>This is a task for a programmer, which Bytensson, unfortunately, is not.</p>
<p>Help him out!</p>
<p>There are $n$ ports and $m$ waterways connecting them in the waters    frequented by the sailors Bytensson listened to.</p>
<p>If there is a waterway between two ports, then sailing from one to the    other is possible.  Any waterway can be sailed in both    directions.</p>
<p>Bytensson got to know $k$ seafaring tales.</p>
<p>Each tells of a sailor who began his journey in one port,    sailed a number of waterways, and ended up in another port,    which may have been the one he initially set sail from.</p>
<p>The sailor in question may have sailed through the same waterway    many times, each time in any direction.</p>
<p>给n个点m条边无向图，每次询问两个点之间是否有长度为d的路径（不一定是简单路径）</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>In the first line of the standard input, there are three integers, $n$,$m$ and $k$ ($2\le n\le 5\ 000$, $1\le m\le 5\ 000$, $1\le k\le 1\ 000\ 000$).</p>
<p>These denote, respectively: the number of ports in the waters      frequented by the sailors who told Bytensson their stories,the number of waterways, and the number of tales.</p>
<p>The $m$ lines that follow specify the waterways.</p>
<p>A single waterway's description consists of a single line that contains two integers, $a$ and $b$ ($1\le a,b\le n$,$a\ne b$), separated by a single space; these specify the numbers of ports at the two ends of this particular waterway.</p>
<p>The $k$ lines that follow specify the tales that Bytensson has heard. A single tale's description consists of a single line with three integers,$s$,$t$,and $d$ ($1\le s,t\le n$,$1\le d\le 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$ ), separated by single spaces. These indicate that the tale's protagonist set sail from port no. $s$ , ended the journey in port no. $t$ , and sailed exactly $d$ times through various waterways.</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>Your program should print exactly $k$ lines to the standard output; the $i$-th of them should contain the word TAK (Polish for yes) if the journey described in the $i$-th tale(in input order) could have taken place.</p>
<p>If it could not, then the line should contain the word NIE (Polish for no).</p>
