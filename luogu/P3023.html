<h2>题目描述</h2>
<p>The cows are playing with wires! They have learned a technique called soldering, in which they connect two pieces of wire together by attaching the endpoint of one wire to a location along the length of the other. (Soldering endpoint to endpoint is not allowed.) There can be multiple solder junctions at the same point.</p>
<p>The cows have a plan for an Amazing Structure they would like to build. It is in the form of a graph with N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50,000) nodes and N-1 edges of unit length so that each pair of nodes is connected. Each edge is described by a pair of integers, A and B (1 &lt;= A &lt;= N; 1 &lt;= B &lt;= N; A != B).</p>
<p>The cows are able to buy wire from a local store; however longer wire is more expensive. In particular the cows can buy a wire of length L with cost L*L, but they cannot cut wires or join wires together.</p>
<p>Given the plan, the cows would like solder wires together to build their Amazing Structure. Please help them find the minimum possible cost!</p>
<p>Test data worth at least 50% of the points will have N &lt;= 2,000.</p>
<p>Partial feedback will be provided on your first 50 submissions to this problem.</p>

<p>奶牛决定用电线焊接出一个特殊图形，这个图形是连通的，由N个点，N -1条边组成， 每条边的长度都是1。焊接所用的电线要从当地的商店里买。越长的电线越贵，一条长度为 L的电线售价为L^2 。 奶牛们已经学会了基本的焊接方法， 她们会把某条电线的一个端点焊接到另一条电线的 中间某个位置， 但她们没有学会如何把两条电线的端点直接焊接起来， 也没有学会怎么把电 线剪断。 告诉你奶牛准备焊接的图形，请告诉奶牛怎么焊接才能最节约材料费用。</p>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h4>输入格式</h4>
<p>* Line 1: A single integer: N</p>
<p>* Lines 2..N: Two space-separated integers describing an edge: A and B</p>
<h4>输出格式</h4>
<p>* Line 1: A single integer, the cost of soldering the tree together. Note that this number may not always fit in a 32-bit integer.</p>

<h2>说明</h2>
<p>Since all nodes in the structure are connected to node 1, we only need to buy one wire of length 2 and three of length 1, for a total cost of 2 * 2 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 7.</p>
